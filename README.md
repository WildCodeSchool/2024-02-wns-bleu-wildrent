üå≥ **Branches**

Each feature is related to a branch :

- Pull your new branch from ```dev``` to avoid conflict.
- Use the following syntax : ```<type>/ <ticket number> / <name>```  (ex: ```feature/32/authentication```)
- Use one of the following type :
    - ```build``` : Make changes about dependencies or build system
    - ```feat``` : Add a new feature.
    - ```fix``` : Fix a bug.
    - ```refactor``` : Update the code but won‚Äôt add or fix anything (variable naming, code simplification‚Ä¶).
    - ```chore``` : Remove and clean some code.

- Don't forget to make the branch name as explicit as possible, and always in :uk: :us: English :us: :uk: !

:trident: **Pull requests & merge**

‚õîÔ∏è We never merge without a pull request and a code review

- Once you‚Äôve created a branch for your feature, you will push it at some point. The first time you do it, you can make a pull request.
- It‚Äôs a work in progress ? Mark your pull request as a draft.
- It‚Äôs completed and needs a review ? Mark your pull request as ready for review.
- Once a pull request is ready for review, we change the status of the task, and we notice the rest of the team via discord channel
