BRANCHES AND COMMIT RULES ARE ALWAYS WRITTEN IN ENGLISH 

Branches: 
Each feature is related to a branch :
Pull your new branch from dev to avoid conflict.
Use the following syntax : <type>/ <ticket> / <name>
=>  feature/32/authentication

Use one of the following type :
feat : Add a new feature.
fix : Fix a bug.
refactor : Update the code but won’t add or fix anything (variable naming, code simplification…).
chore : Remove and clean some code.
Finally, make the branch name as explicit as possible !

Commits : 
Naming convention for commits :
Use the following syntax : <type> : <subject> 
=> feat : add users's controller

Use one of the following type :
feat : Add a new feature.
fix : Fix a bug.
build : Make changes about dependencies or build system (npm, yarn, gulp…).
docs : Add or update the documentation.
perf : Improve the app’s performance.
refactor : Update the code but won’t add or fix anything (variable naming, code simplification…).
style : Update the code styling (indentation…).
test : Add or update testing.

Pull request & merge
⛔️ We never merge without a pull request (equivalent to merge request on gitlab) and a code review

Once you’ve created a branch for your feature, you will push it at some point. The first time you do it, you can make a pull request.
It’s a work in progress ? Mark your pull request as a draft.
It’s completed and needs a review ? Mark your pull request as ready for review.
once a pull request is ready for review, we change the status of the task, and we notice the rest of the team via discord channel 

Think a new rule would be useful ? Let's talk about it !
